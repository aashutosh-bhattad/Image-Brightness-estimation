# Image-Brightness-estimation
Deteting Brightness of an image in a scale of 0 to 10 using OpenCV




Prease refer Code.ipynb: for comments and code description




Libraries used:
OpenCV (!pip install opencv-python)
imutils(!pip install imutils)




Train and validation data:
A few sample images from google has been used to check performance.




Instructions:
1.Install the above mentioned libraries.
2.Change the working directory of the py file to where the images are located.
3.Input the name of image file in line No. 7 of code.ipynb file for which brightness needs to be calculated.
4.The remaining code can be run without any change.




Output:
Output is obtained as average brightness on a scale of 0 to 10.
